# Personality Prediction using Machine Learning and MBTI Dataset

## Motivation

The project explores the intersection of personality psychology and machine learning, leveraging the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) dataset. The goal is to predict personality types based on written text, offering insights into decision-making, interactions, and various aspects of individuals' lives. The project contributes to advancements in psychology and artificial intelligence, potentially aiding in personalized interventions, education, and career guidance.

## Abstract

This project employs machine learning, Neuro language programming, and XGBoost to predict personality types from MBTI data. The developed methodology showcases superior accuracy compared to existing methods. The project aims to assist NLP practitioners and psychologists in identifying personality types and associated cognitive processes.

## Introduction

Personality psychology studies individual differences and their impact on behavior, thoughts, and emotions. The project predicts personality types from text using machine learning on the MBTI dataset. Various steps include data preparation, feature extraction, and model building. Machine learning algorithms such as CatBoost, XGBoost, and decision trees are used to predict personality types.

## Objective

1. Develop a machine learning model for accurate personality prediction.
2. Compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
3. Evaluate the impact of pre-processing techniques on model performance.

## Model Evaluation

The CatBoost Classifier, with an accuracy of 0.672622, outperformed other models, making it the chosen model for personality prediction.

## Prediction using CatBoost model

A sample input resulted in the prediction of "ENTP" personality, with traits like innovation, curiosity, logical thinking, and suitability for roles such as Entrepreneur or Data Scientist.

## Conclusion

The project successfully employs machine learning to predict personality types, with the CatBoost model showing high accuracy. The insights gained can be applied in education, psychology, and human resource management.

## Future Scope

- Personalized marketing
- Recommender systems
- Human resource management
- Psychological counseling
- Education
- Mental health diagnosis
- Social media targeting
- Product development
